## Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Anton. With a solid foundation in science and particularly archaeology and a deep passion for technology, I'm now focusing on software development. I've always been enthusiastic about tech, and I'm currently developing web apps and scripts for innovative projects in archaeology. My aim is to fully transition into software development, combining my scientific expertise with my growing tech skills to create impactful solutions.
